# flight_planner
efficient graph-based system using adjacency lists to model cities and flights, minimizing the number of flights, reducing costs, or balancing both factors using BFS and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm

Details:
This project is a flight planning system designed to simulate real-world scenarios of choosing optimal flight routes between cities. Developed as part of an academic assignment, it incorporates efficient algorithms to address various user requirements, such as minimizing flights, reducing costs, or balancing both.

Features
The Flight Planner offers the following functionalities:

Route with Fewest Flights and Earliest Arrival: Identifies the optimal route between two cities with the minimum number of flights, prioritizing the earliest arrival.

Cheapest Route: Calculates the route with the lowest total fare, regardless of the number of flights.

Fewest Flights and Cheapest Route: Finds the route with the minimum number of flights and the lowest cost among such routes.
